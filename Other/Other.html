        <h1><b>OTHER</b><br>WHY SHOULD ME <span class="ques"><b>?</b></h1>

        <p class="text1">Because I have the ability to work in this position.
            I have a responsibility for the work I do and I am fully responsible for all the work that needs to be done.
            I may not be good, but I have the ability. Both adaptation And I am confident in my ability that if you take
            me,
            you will not be disappointed in choosing me today.</p>

            <h1><b>INSPI</b>RATION</h1>
            <p class="text2">I'm very inspired by Lailah Gifty Akita, a teacher at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science
                and Technology.
                She said: <b>“Do not worry about who get the credit or praise of the work done.
                    Continue work to give your best. .Your reward may come unexpected. ”</b>
                That is what made me hold on to my work all the time. A lot of times,
                I often have to accept group work alone or have an unequal division of work.
                A lot of times I may get discouraged at work, but I think that someday what I do will be able to expand
                and give me many times more experience than everyone else
