            <p>The career that I want to be at the moment is undecided,
                but there are two things that I am interested in <b>UX / UI Design</b> because I am a person who likes
                to experiment with
                different types of applications, and I tend to like to observe the design of that application and
                think about how if we are a designer, how do you like it and like others the most And another profession
                is the <b>Database Administrator.</b> I am interested because when there was a base adjustment camp
                learned about it.
                And I feel that it is challenging and fun, and I am also a person who likes to work with organization as
                well.
